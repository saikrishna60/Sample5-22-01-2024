    <h6>Establishing Successful Online Distance Learning Environments 191</h6>

    <p>online distance learning through courses and full degree programs at the
    post-secondary and high school levels. Such courses and programs may
    include some face-to-face interaction, but the teacher and student are 
    separated for the majority of activities. One or more forms of technology
    are used to mediate the teaching, and several forms of technology may be 
    used for communication</p>

    <p>Distance education has long been viewed as a way in which to offer
     lifelong learning to those who are geographically separated from traditional
    institutions, have obligations that limit their ability to attend regular courses,
    or prefer to learn in new ways. One challenge has been to balance the need for
    intense and personal interaction with the reality of limited financial and other
    resources. Organizations and universities have turned to technology that has
    evolved to the point where it can provide the needed experiences through
    electronic networks and groupware (Gerencher, 1998; Mangan, 1999; Schrum,
     1998). This chapter presents a review of the trend towards online distanc
    learning environments by identifying challenges to faculty, students, and
     program planners.</p>

    <div><h2>BACKGROUND EXPERIENCES</h2></div>

    <p>Several previous studies were analyzed and amalgamated in this chapter.
    Schrum and Benson (2000a; 2000b; 2000c) investigated the first two years of
    a collaborative effort between a large financial corporation and a large
    southeastern university College of Business’s MBA program to provide
    expanded learning opportunities for the corporation’s professional workers
    who wished to further their education while maintaining full-time employ-
    ment. In a qualitative case study of a distance learning consortium launched
    by the university system of a southeastern state, Benson (2001) described and
    analyzed the planning and implementation of the consortium’s first online
    degree programs from the perspectives of the primary stakeholders: the
    consortium planning committee, the administrators at the universities provid-
    ing the courses, the instructors developing and delivering the courses, the
    students enrolled in the courses, the university system administration, and the
    business community with workforce needs. Schrum (1998; 2000) identified
    characteristics of successful online learners, based on literature and inter-
    views. In a qualitative case study of students enrolled in two online school
    library media courses at a large southeastern university, Benson et al. (in
    press) and Tallman and Benson (2000) investigated the effectiveness of
    online course delivery for the university’s school library media program.
    From these four studies and the relevant literature, the authors have identified</p>

     <p>factors that influence educators’ success in teaching in this context, specific
    dimensions that appear to influence student success, and factors that contri-
    bute to the overall success in creating online programs.</p>

    <div><h2>CONSIDERATIONS OF DISTANCE LEARNING<br/>
     FOR EDUCATORS</h2></div>

    <p><b>Teaching in Online Distance Learning Environments</b></p>
    <p>Educators face specific challenges in moving from their comfort zone
    in traditional classrooms to teaching in online distance environments.
    Faculty members have had an especially difficult time changing the ways
    in which they teach, regardless of their own personal use of electronic
    media (Candiotti & Clarke, 1998). In an online environment, the role of
    faculty changes in many ways. Specifically, the traditional hierarchy is
    flattened, and the power and control are redistributed. Faculty are forced
    to develop and design their activities and interactions in new ways, and
    they may be frustrated without the ability to recognize students’ furrowed
     brows (Schrum & Berge, 1998).</p>

    <p>Faculty members, with little knowledge or experience of teaching
     online, also have voiced uncertainty about their abilities to provide
     appropriate educational experiences and opportunities, design meaning-
    ful interaction, and meet the needs of all their students. They worry about
    the extra time demands necessary to teach successfully in this manner, and
    specifically if meeting those time demands would be counted toward the
     yardstick of promotion and tenure. Further, librarians voiced concerns
    that some students who have few skills in evaluation of Web information,
     bibliographic searching or retrieval strategies may take online classes.
     Their worry is that this lack of knowledge would negatively impact
    students’ success and learning.</p>

    <p>Kember (1995) urged instructors to work toward deep learning,
    which requires moving away from excessive assignments, shallow assess-
    ments, and lack of freedom in activities. Heeren and Lewis (1997)
    suggested matching the media with the task, keeping media lean for tasks
    that do not require much interaction such as electronic mail, and reserving
    rich media for things that require more interaction and a broader spectrum
    of activity. These challenges go far beyond the instructor’s need to be
    comfortable with the reliance on technology to support their courses
    (Schrum, 1998).</p>

    <br><br/>
 
    <h6>Establishing Successful Online Distance Learning Environments 193</h6>

    <h3>Course Design in Online Distance Learning Environments</h3>

    <p>Wiesenberg and Hutton (1996) identified three major challenges for the
    online course designer to consider: accommodating the increased time for
    delivery of the course (they estimate two or three times what is necessary for
    a traditional course), the creation of a community online, and encouraging
    students to become independent learners. Before any decisions can be made
    about delivery or models, however, each instructor must make pedagogical
    decisions about the fundamental goals of a course. The salient questions when
    creating an educational experience have always been, “What are the instruc-
    tional and personal goals of this course for all students?” and “What is the
    purpose of this course?” These are questions that all educators must ask
    themselves when designing courses, and in general, they have become
    comfortable and adept at doing this.</p>

    <p>The structure of the course, the planning for educational and personal
     needs, and the teacher’s role must all be reconceptualized. It is clear that
    active and independent learning must take place. The designer will have
    to determine what actions will promote this type of learning. Further, from
    adult learning theory, it is clear that authentic learning, relevant materials,
    and negotiated assignments are required to ensure the participation,
    involvement, and action necessary to meet these goals. This is an ideal
    opportunity to create a Development Team, composed of a Subject Matter
    Expert (SME), an instructional designer, and at least one person with
    experience in distance education</p>

    <p><h3>Evaluation in Online Distance Learning Environments</h3></p>

    <p>The nature of online teaching requires the instructor to rethink the
    evaluation process as well. The evaluation component must be ongoing and
    continual; just leaving everything to one midterm and a final paper would put
    everyone at a disadvantage. The instructor must become familiar with each
    student’s work, and the only way to accomplish that is through many
    instructional activities. One possibility is to have weekly questions for
    students to answer individually, even if the students are working on group
    projects. They may have to answer a content question, or explain something
    in the readings. They may also be asked to explain what they have done in the
    various parts of the course.</p>

    <p>A feedback loop is also essential, so perhaps it is wise to include specific
    times during the term when students fill out an anonymous questionnaire
    regarding the progress and process of the course. Some faculty members have
    included one question each week that requires students to consider various
    aspects of the content, interaction, and affective reaction to the online</p>

    <br><br/>

    <h6>194 Schrum & Benson</h6>

    <p>environment. It is important that the teacher respond to class concerns, when<br/>
    possible, to demonstrate attention to students’ needs.</p>

    <div><h2>CHALLENGES OF ONLINE DISTANCE<br/>
    LEARNING FOR LEARNERS</h2></div>

    <p>earners face incredible challenges in adapting to online distance learn-
    ing. Cognitive science and software engineers suggest that individuals must
    create mental models to be able to understand and internalize what is
    happening in this new environment (Brandt, 1997). One study suggested that
    students had to take time to move through the initial efforts of learning the
    tools before they began constructing new knowledge (Yakimovicz & Murphy,
    1995). Another study confirms the necessity for learners to have support to
    learn and act out their roles in these situations (Olson & Bly, 1991).</p>

    <p>One graduate course demonstrated that even in the case of having
        independent online lessons, it was useful to add a component that required
        students to interact with their colleagues in some way (Dehler & Poirras-
        Hernandez, 1998). Eastmond (1995) found that students reported feelings of
        isolation if they didn’t keep up with the interactions, and had to be taught to
        take personal responsibility for involving themselves. Similarly, it is impor-
        tant to build in practice opportunities for the students to refine their evaluative
        and analytical skills to be able to successfully use the enormous amount of
        information on the Internet (King, 1998).</p>
    <p>In recent work, Schrum (2001) identified seven dimensions of student
        success in online distance learning environments. These were the result of
        investigations of assessment instruments and information gathering from
        experienced online educators. While these dimensions are presented
        separately, in reality they do not function independently. Rather, they are
        similar to an organic system, and work together to support or challenge the
        online learner.</p>

    <h3>Access to Tools</h3>

    <p>The first dimension concerns tools that students must have readily
        available. Research has demonstrated that easy access to technology, at home
        or at work, is one of the most significant contributors to success in online
        learning environments (Benson & Wright, 1999; Bonk & Dennen, 1999;
        Schrum, 1998). It is worthwhile to create a minimum standard for hardware
        and software, including peripherals. An institution can provide a convenient
        and effective way of ensuring that student equipment meets the standards by</p>

    <br><br/>

    <h6>Establishing Successful Online Distance Learning Environments 195</h6>

    <p>offering a free mini-course to experiment with the components and also to
        demonstrate exactly what an online learning experience might be like.</p>
    
    <h3>Technology Experience</h3>

    <p>While having convenient access to the tools is the first step, experience
        using the tools for personal or work-related activities is also important. More
        than one study has suggested that students who have little technological
        experience delay learning new content while they learn the tools (Schrum,
        1998; Yakimovicz & Murphy, 1995). Important experiences for new online
        learners include writing documents using a word processor, printing, sending
        email on a regular basis, sending and receiving files via email, conducting
        searches through the World Wide Web, and accessing online information.</p>

    <p>Students who are comfortable and adept at these tools will be able to
        solve small technical problems, such as rebooting their machine, install-
        ing software, changing printer cartridges, and answering simple configu-
        ration questions. They will also be able to distinguish between the
        problems related to their individual hardware and software that they can
        solve and those problems that are better referred to the system administra-
        tor or institution for assistance.</p>
    <h3>Learning Preferences</h3> 
    
    <p>Students may be concerned that they might miss traditional face-to-face
        instruction. It is true that each person learns in a unique way—in general,
        people know the ways in which they are best able to remember a phone
        number or address. Some people will write it down, others will say it several
        times, and still others will make a rhyme out of it. Each is appropriate for the
        individual who uses it. It is important to recognize that when students learn
        off-campus, individual strengths and weaknesses may be amplified (Bonk & 
        Dennen, 1999). Online instructors must have strategies that accommodate
        these learning preferences.</p>

    <h3>Study Habits and Skills</h3>

    <p>One of the greatest benefits of learning in online distance environments
        is also one of its greatest challenges. Learners appear to appreciate the greater
        control over their learning, yet with that control comes substantial responsi-
        bility for completing assignments and being prepared (Schrum & Benson,
        2000c). Learners must be able to turn off the television and concentrate on
        their work in a timely fashion, in order to stay on track in turning in
        assignments. It is clear that those students who do not keep up with the class
        and the coursework are in greater danger of dropping out. A student may need</p>

    <br><br/>

    <h6>196 Schrum & Benson</h6>

    <p>to assess his/her basic academic proficiencies, such as skimming for informa-
        tion, and then reading the important portions more carefully</p>

    <h3>Goals and Purpose</h3>

    <p>Adults have a variety of reasons for seeking educational experiences, and
        these may include a mandated upgrade of skills, a requirement for additional
        credits to maintain licensure, a need to change careers, or a simple desire to
        gain knowledge. Realization of these goals, however, is often subject to the
        strength of the motivation that drives these desires (Benson, 1998; Schrum &
        Benson, 2000a). Motivation describes the internal and external conditions
        that influence behavior and is one of the most significant factors in persistence
        in online learning (Schrum, 1998). A non-motivated student may experience
        difficulty in completing an online course.</p>

    <h3>Lifestyle Factors</h3>

    <p>Today’s population leads extremely busy lives–with many adults
        having obligations beyond work. These potential learners must determine
        if they have 10-20 hours a week to devote to studying. They must also
        ascertain if they have flexibility in their schedules, or if little room exists
        for rearrangement. It is vital that learners have the full support of their
        family, friends, and employers. When competing demands put stress on a
        student, they often feel they must give up or minimize their studying to
        keep peace in the family (Schrum & Benson, 2000c). It may also be helpful
        for the student to find someone who has taken distance courses to act as
        a mentor for support and advice.</p>

    <h3>Personal Traits and Characteristics</h3>

    <p>A few of the dimensions have touched on the ways in which individu-
        als study and learn, but this dimension offers a perspective on fundamental
        ways in which individuals actually handle their daily activities, and
        patterns of behavior that go far beyond school-related issues. This in-
        cludes examining the way one completes daily tasks. For example, is the
        individual always on time for appointments, or do simple tasks get
        forgotten in the midst of daily activities? Looking at our personal qualities
        can be somewhat difficult, but it is an important step toward successful
        online learning. If learners are aware of their deficiencies, they can seek
        help in overcoming them. For example, Eastmond (1995) found students
        must be instructed in ways to take personal responsibility for becoming
        involved in the interactions and with their colleagues</p>

    <br><br/>

    <h6>Establishing Successful Online Distance Learning Environments 197</h6>

    <div><h2>CHALLENGES OF PROGRAM PLANNING FOR<br/>
        ONLINE DISTANCE LEARNING</h2></div>

    <p>Administrators and program planners face many challenges in adapting
        degree and certificate programs to an online environment. The distance
        education literature is short on program-level planning models (e.g., Holmberg
        1995; Knott, 1994; Rumble, 1986). For the most part, the literature has
        focused on individual courses (e.g., Andriole, 1997; Benson, 1998; Benson
        & Wright, 1999; Bourne et al., 1997; Cooper, 1999; Lauzon, 1992; Mason,
        1998; Pincas, 1998). Recent research conducted by the authors suggests that
        success with online distance learning at the program level require attention to
        seven key areas: faculty development, technical support, student services,
        curriculum design, program format, course design, and marketing</p>

    <h3>Faculty Development</h3>

    <p>The strength of the faculty largely determines the success of any program,
        traditional or online, but in an online distance learning program, faculty
        development cannot be overemphasized. This development includes techni-
        cal training, pedagogical training, and administrative support.</p>

    <p>irst, faculty must have more than a general familiarity with the technol-
        ogy being used. Faculty teaching online for the first time have identified a
        need for more familiarity with software and hardware (Benson, 2001). Faculty
        members who are familiar with the technology and comfortable with its use
        will be more likely to model appropriate use. Providing opportunities for
        instructors to participate in an online course will give them needed experience
        and allow them to experience the online environment as their students will.
        Some organizations conduct a portion of the technology and pedagogical
        training online to gain this benefit.</p>

    <p>Second, faculty need pedagogical training to be successful in this new
        environment. In many ways the technology training and the pedagogical
        training go hand-in-hand. Introducing faculty to the interactions model of
        learning is an effective way to begin the pedagogical training. The interactions
        model specifies four types of interactions required for an effective learning
        environment: learner to instructor, learner to content, learner to learner, and
        learner to technology (Hillman, Willis, & Gunawardena, 1994; Moore, 1989).
        Once faculty start thinking of their courses in terms of these interactions, they
        can be introduced to online tools that facilitate the interactions. For example,
        asynchronous communication over a bulletin board or discussion list can
        facilitate the learner to learner interaction.</p>

    <br><br/>

    <h6>198 Schrum & Benson</h6>

    <p>Faculty also must have appropriate administrative support and concomi-
        tant rewards if they are to be successful in an online environment. Faculty
        members require freedom to perform in the online distance learning environ-
        ment without being forced to adhere unnecessarily to the restraints and
        constraints of the traditional classroom. For example, the performance review
        process for faculty teaching online must accommodate the differences be-
        tween teaching online and teaching in a traditional classroom. Peers of the
        online instructor may not understand the additional demands on an instructor
        teaching online and thus, may not account for those differences in their peer
        reviews. Traditional course evaluations may not address the specifics of the
        online course, so new course evaluations may need to be introduced into the
        program structure. These evaluations may need to be delivered in nontradi-
        tional ways (Schrum & Benson, 2000c).</p>

    <h3>Technical Support</h3>

    <p>Technical support is a mandatory requirement. Technical support goes
        beyond providing continued technical training and includes the ongoing
        support that faculty and students need. Faculty and students experiencing
        online distance learning for the first time will run into problems; however,
        these problems can be overcome if an adequate support system is provided.
        Help Desk functions are now commonly associated with online distance
        learning programs. Many institutions and organizations provide such func-
        tions on a 24 hours/7 days a week basis to accommodate the “anytime,
        anyplace” nature of online learning (Benson, 2001).</p>

    <h3>Student Services</h3>

    <p>Student Services are important in online distance learning environments.
        Online students require all the support functions of traditional students: registra-
        tion, financial aide, bookstore, library services, counseling, and access to appro-
        priate equipment and technology. Since the online student is learning at a distance,
        Student Services functions need to be provided online. It is obvious how a school’s
        registration, financial aide, bookstore, and library functions can be put online, but
        online counseling is a relatively new area (Benson, 2001).</p>

    <p>First, online learning students should be assigned a single counselor
        whom they can contact for all issues related to their experience, and this
        person should be trained to address a wide variety of student concerns. 
        would be unfair to force the online student to have eight points of contact.
        Second, this counselor must be knowledgeable about learning in an online
        environment so that she or he can provide the specialized support required by
        these learners.</p>

    <br><br/>

    <h6>Establishing Successful Online Distance Learning Environments 199</h6>

    <h3>Curriculum Design</h3>
 
    <p>Choosing a curriculum for an online distance learning program is
        nontrivial. Educational institutions want to assure that their online pro-
        gram meets regional accreditation standards, and fortunately, many ac-
        creditation associations have developed criteria. For example, traditional
        standards require a fixed amount of face-to-face time for each credit hour
        assigned to a course. Obviously, that requirement can’t be met in an online
        distance learning environment, so a revised requirement is needed. Ac-
        crediting agencies are beginning to examine these kinds of differences and
        to provide alternative standards more suited to the online environment
        (Benson, 2001).</p>

    <p>Another curriculum issue concerns the determination of which courses
        to offer in the online program. Successful online programs have tended to
        limit the number of student course options (Schrum & Benson, 2000a).
        For example, a student in an on-campus MBA program may have seven
        specialization areas from which to choose, while the online student may
        only have two. As more students choose online program delivery, in-
        creased options may be provided to them.</p>

    <p>A final curriculum issue deals with the structure of course offerings.
        Programs may choose a cohort model, an independent study model, or
        some variation of both. In the cohort model, students progress lock step
        through the courses in the program, typically on a traditional school-year
        schedule. In the independent study model, students are free to enroll in
        courses at any time, and are given a fixed time to complete each course.
        Few programs have chosen this latter option. Most choose a pure cohort
        system, or a modified cohort system. In the modified cohort system,
        students enroll in a course in the program and move through that course
        in a lock-step fashion, but they don’t necessarily move through all the
        courses in the program together (Benson, 2001).</p>

    <h3>Program Technologies</h3>

    <p>A key to program success in online distance learning environments is the
        use of multiple technologies. Varying combinations of email, bulletin boards,
        chat rooms, white boards, audio, and streaming media can provide significant
        value to an online course. While instructors may be warned to avoid lecturing
        online, recent research has shown that students have a favorable attitude
        towards the use of narrated PowerPoint presentations to supplement their
        coursework (Schrum & Benson, 2000b). Of course, not all students will find
        all media equally valuable, but using multiple media will give students
        choices and address a variety of learning style preferences</p>

    <br><br/>

    <h6>200 Schrum & Benson</h6>

    <p>any programs have come to rely almost exclusively on online technolo-
        gies and ignore the value of using the telephone, fax, and even face-to-face
        experiences to supplement the online experience. Online students should feel
        as free to call an instructor during office hours as they do to send him or her
        an email message, or visit him or her in a chat room. Programs using the cohort
        model have found success with initial face-to-face sessions where they begin
        building a sense of community among the enrolled students. For many
        programs that initial face-to-face session is the only contact the cohort has;
        other programs have chosen to infuse their design with multiple face-to-face
        sessions (Schrum & Benson, 2000a). The choice depends on the nature of the
        program and financial resources of the students who would have to travel to
        the meeting site.</p>

    <h3>Course Design</h3>

    <p>Course design in the online distance learning environment is the focus of
        much discussion and research. Everyone seems to agree that developing an
        online course requires more than physically moving the course to the
        electronic medium; rather, the course and its goals must be reconceptualized
        for the new medium. Similarly, when moving an entire program, the courses
        must be reconceptualized as part of the online program. For example, research
        shows that asynchronous bulletin boards can be used to support the learner-
        learner interaction as well as higher-order thinking skills (Shapley, 2000);
        thus, online instructors may want to make use of this tool. In reconceptualizing
        the courses as part of an online program, faculty members may decide to have
        a common bulletin board for discussion of topics related to multiple courses.
        Alternatively, faculty members may choose to redistribute one course’s
        content across multiple courses</p>

        <p>All the courses in a single program may have a consistent look and feel.
            Unless there is a valid reason dictated by course content and learning goals,
            students should not be required to learn a new set of tools for each course in
            the program. A tool set should be established at the program level, and those
            tools used by all faculty.</p>

        <h3>Marketing and Pricing</h3>
    
       <p>Marketing and pricing the online program should not be ignored. Some
        institutions have found success by entering into partnerships with corpora-
        tions to provide online degrees and programs for the corporations’ employees
        (Schrum & Benson, 2000c). These institutions have been able to fully recover
        their costs, and in many cases, make a profit. Other institutions have targeted
        a specific student population in a specific subject area, and spent marketing</p>
